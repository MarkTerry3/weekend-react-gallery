# Weekend React Gallery


## Description

In this project I created a picture gallery using React. This application was full stack. I added a like button to resemble a social media site, which talked to a database to update the number of likes. You can click on a picture to view its description, or click it again to go back to the picture, this feature also utilized the database.
